# POLYCYSTIC-OVARY-SYNDROME-PCOS-DIAGNOSIS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
**<span style="color:teal;"> Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) </span>** is a hormonal condition that affects many women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may have irregular or prolonged menstrual cycles, as well as high levels of the male hormone androgen. The ovaries may produce a large number of tiny collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to release eggs on a regular basis. (Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/symptoms-causes/syc-20353439#:~:text=Polycystic%20ovary%20syndrome%20(PCOS)%20is,fail%20to%20regularly%20release%20eggs)

The high prevalence of PCOS (12.6%) among Malaysian women could indicate the emergence of a public health problem in the country.

The following are some of the most common PCOS symptoms:

1) Periods that are irregular or nonexistent.

2) Having trouble getting pregnant (because of irregular ovulation or failure to ovulate)

3) Hair growth that is excessive which  typically on the face, chest, back, or buttocks.

4) gaining weight

5) Hair thinning and hair loss on the head

6) Acne or greasy skin

In this project, we have proposed a Random Forest Classifier as the best model for PCOS Diagnosis.
